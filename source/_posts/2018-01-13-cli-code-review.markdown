I do the bulk of my code reviews from the command line, especially when
reviewing larger changes. I've built up a number of tools and config
settings that help me dig into the nuances of the code I'm reviewing, so
that I can understand it better than if I were just browsing online.

In particular, I'll walk through how I...

- check out the code in the first place,
- get a feel for what changed,
- visualize the relationships between the files that changed,
- bring up the code diffs in Vim,
- leverage the unique power of the editor and the terminal.

But first, let's talk briefly about the point of code review in the
first place.


## Code review philosophy

When I ask that other people review my code, it's an opportunity for me
to teach them about the change I've just made. When I review someone
else's code, it's to learn something from them. Some other benefits of
code review include:

- Team awareness (to keep a pulse on what else is going on within your
  team).
- Finding alternative solutions (maybe there's a small change that lets
  us kill two birds with one stone).

If this is different from how you think about code review, [check out
this talk][code-review-culture]. Code review is a powerful tool for
learning and growing a team.

With that out of the way, let's dive into the tools I use to maximize
benefit I get from code review.

## Checking out the code

The first step to reviewing code in the terminal is to check out the
code in the first place. One option is to simply to `git pull` and then
`git checkout <branch>`. But if you happen to be using GitHub, we can
get this down to just one command:

```
hub pr checkout <pr-number>
```

It works using [hub], which is a tool that exposes various features of
GitHub from the command line. If the pull request is from someone else's
fork, `hub` is even smart enough to add their fork as a remote and fetch
it.

## At first glance

With the branch checked out locally, usually my next step is to get a
feel for what changed. For this, I've written a git alias that shows:

- which files changed
- how many lines changed in each file (additions and deletions)
- how many lines changed overall

{% img fullwidth /images/git-stat.png git stat %}

Here's the definition of `git stat` from my `~/.gitconfig`:

```bash
[alias]
	# list files which have changed since REVIEW_BASE
	# (REVIEW_BASE defaults to 'master' in my zshrc)
	files = !git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD \"$REVIEW_BASE\")

	# Same as above, but with a diff stat instead of just names
	# (better for interactive use)
	stat = !git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD \"$REVIEW_BASE\")
```

Under the hood, it just works using `git diff`, `git merge-base`, and a
personal environment variable `REVIEW_BASE`.

`REVIEW_BASE` lets us choose which branch to review relative to. Most of
the time, `REVIEW_BASE` is `master`, but this isn't always the case! Some
repos branch off of `gh-pages`. Sometimes I like to review the most
recent commit as if it were its own branch.

To review the code relative so some other base, set `REVIEW_BASE` before
running `git stat`:

```bash
# Review between 'gh-pages' and the current branch
REVIEW_BASE=gh-pages git stat

# Review changes made by the last commit of this branch:
REVIEW_BASE=HEAD^ git stat
```

I have `export REVIEW_BASE=master` in my `~/.bashrc`, because most
projects branch off of `master`.

Nothing too crazy yet---GitHub can already do everything we've seen so
far. Let's start to up the ante.


## Visualizing file change frequency

I've written a short script that shows me a visualization of how
frequently the files involved in this branch change over time:

{% img fullwidth /images/git-heatmap.png git heatmap %}

This command identifies two main things:

- **Files with lots of changes**.

  Files that have changed a lot in the past are likely to change in the
  future. I review these files with an eye towards what the *next*
  change will bring.

  *"Is this change robust enough to still be useful in the future?
  Will we throw this out soon after merging it?"*

- **Files with few changes**.

  Files that aren't changed frequently are more likely to be brittle.
  Alternatively, it's often the case that infrequently changed files
  stay unchanged because the change is better made elsewhere.

  *"Does this change challenge an implicit assumption so that some other
  part of the code was relying on? Is there a better place for this
  change?"*

Those two commands (`git stat` and `git heatmap`) are how I kick off my
code review: getting a birds-eye view of the change and some historical
context for what I'm dealing with. Next, I drill down into the
relationships between the files that changed.


## Visualizing relationships between files

At work I review JavaScript files, so I've built out this next bit of
tooling specifically for JavaScript.[^mldepgraph] It helps to understand
which files import others, so I have a command that computes the
dependency graph of the files changed on this branch:

[^mldepgraph]: The techniques here apply to any language that you can statically analyze. In particular, I have a rough prototype of everything JavaScript-specific you see here that works with Standard ML instead. If you can find me the dependency information for your favorite language, I'd be happy to help you turn it into a visualization.

{% img fullwidth /images/git-depgraph.png git depgraph %}

This is where we start to see some distinct advantages over what GitHub
provides. As you see above, the `git depgraph` alias calculates the
dependency graph for files changed by this branch. Why is this useful?

- Maybe we want to start reviewing from `Provider.js`, since it doesn't
  depend on any other files that have changed.

- Maybe we want to work the other way: start with `Elements.js` so we
  know the motivation for why `Provider.js` had to changed in the first
  place.

In either case, we can see the structure of the change. Three files
depend on `Elements.js`, so it's serving the needs of many modules.
`Element.js` only has one dependency, etc. Each branch's dependency
graph shows different information; it can be surprising what turns up.

I have the `git depgraph` alias defined like this:

```bash
[alias]
	depgraph = !git madge image --webpack-config webpack.config.js --basedir . --style solarized-dark src
```

Some notes about this definition:

- It depends on the `git-madge` command, which you can [download
  and install here][git-madge].

- It's using *this project's* `webpack.config.js` file, so I've made
  this alias local to the repo, rather than available globally.

- It dumps the image to stdout. Above, we used iTerm2's [imgcat]
  program to pipe stdin and dump a raster image to the terminal.

  If you don't use iTerm2 or don't want to install `imgcat`, you can
  pipe it to Preview using open[^open] (`open -f -a Preview`) or just
  redirect the PNG to a file.

[^open]: The `open` command is macOS-specific. On Linux, you might want to look at the `display` command from ImageMagick.

[imgcat]: https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html

The `git depgraph` alias is a game changer. It makes it easier to get spun
up in new code bases, helps make sense of large changes, and just looks
plain cool. But at the end of the day, we came here to review some code,
so let's take a look at how we can actually view the diffs of the files
that changed.


## Reviewing the diffs

To review the diffs, the simplest option is to just run `git diff
master..HEAD`. This has a bunch of downsides:

- No syntax highlighting (everything is either green or red).

- No surrounding context (for example, GitHub lets you click to expand
  lines above or below a diff hunk).

- The diff is "unified," instead of split into two columns.

- No way to exclude a specific file (the 300 line diff to your
  `yarn.lock` file is sometimes nice to hide).

My solution to all of these problems is to view the diffs in Vim, with
the help of two Vim plugins and two git aliases. Before we get to
that, here's a screenshot:

{% img fullwidth /images/git-review.png git review %}

Looks pretty similar to GitHub's interface, with the added bonus that
it's using my favorite colorscheme! The Vim plugins featured are:

- [tpope/vim-fugitive] for showing the side-by-side diff (`:Gdiff`).
- [airblade/vim-gitgutter] for showing the `+/-` signs.
- [jez/vim-colors-solarized] for tweaking the diff highlight
  colors.[^vcs]

[^vcs]: I've patched the default Solarized colors for Vim so that lines retain their syntax highlighting in the diff mode, while the backgrounds are highlighted. You can see how this works in this commit: <https://github.com/jez/vim-colors-solarized/commit/bca72cc>

[tpope/vim-fugitive]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive
[airblade/vim-gitgutter]: https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter
[jez/vim-colors-solarized]: https://github.com/jez/vim-colors-solarized

And to orchestrate the whole thing, I've set up these two aliases:

```bash
[alias]
  # NOTE: These aliases depend on the `git files` alias from
  # a few sections ago!

	# Open all files changed since REVIEW_BASE in Vim tabs
	# Then, run fugitive's :Gdiff in each tab, and finally
	# tell vim-gitgutter to show +/- for changes since REVIEW_BASE
	review = !vim -p $(git files) +\"tabdo Gdiff $REVIEW_BASE\" +\"let g:gitgutter_diff_base = '$REVIEW_BASE'\"

	# Same as the above, except specify names of files as arguments,
	# instead of opening all files:
	# git reviewone foo.js bar.js
	reviewone = !vim -p +\"tabdo Gdiff $REVIEW_BASE\" +\"let g:gitgutter_diff_base = '$REVIEW_BASE'\"
```

Here's how they work:

- `git review` opens each file changed by this branch as a tab in Vim.
  Then `:Gdiff` from vim-fugitive shows the diff in each tab.

- `git reviewone` is like `git review`, but you specify which
  files to open (in case you only want to diff a few).

Like with the `git stat` alias, these aliases respect the `REVIEW_BASE`
environment variable I've set up in my `~/.bashrc`. (Scroll back up for
a refresher.) For example, to review all files relative to `master`:

```bash
REVIEW_BASE=master git review
```

At this point, you might think that all we've done is re-create the
GitHub code review experience in Vim. But actually what we've done is so
much more powerful.


## Interactive Code Review

When reviewing on GitHub, the code is completely static---you can't
change it. Also, because the code is coming from GitHub's servers,
it's laggy when you click around to view related files. By switching our
code review to the terminal, we can now edit files, jump to other files,
and run arbitrary commands at no cost.

It might not be obvious how huge of a win this is, so let's see some
examples. Take this screenshot of the `requireElement` function. It
moved from *above* the `findElement` function to *below* it (probably
because the former calls the latter):

{% img fullwidth /images/requireElement01.png diff %}

But is the location of the `requireElement` function the only thing
that's changed? By editing the file to move the function back to its
original location, vim-fugitive will automatically recompute the diff.
And in fact, we can see that the *type of the argument* has changed too,
from `string` to `ElementType`:

{% img fullwidth /images/requireElement02.png diff %}

If we had been viewing this on GitHub, we might have taken for granted
that the function didn't change. But since we're in our editor, we can
interactively play around with our code and discover things we might
have missed otherwise. The advantages of interactive code review go well
beyond this example:

- In a Flow project, we can ask for the type of a variable.

- In a test file, we can change the test and see if it still passes or
  if it now fails.

- We can `grep` the project for all uses of a function (including files
  *not* changed by this branch).

- We can open up related files for cross-referencing.

- We can run the code in a debugger and see how it behaves.

By having the full power of our editor, we can literally retrace the
steps that the author went through to create the pull request. If our
goal is to understand and learn from code review, there's no better way
than walking in the author's shoes.


## Recap

To recap, here's a list of the tools I use to review code at the command
line:

- `hub pr checkout`
- `git stat` to list files that have changed
- `git heatmap` to show how frequently these files change
- `git depgraph` to show a graph of which files depend on which
- `git review` to open diffs of all the files in Vim
- `git reviewone` to open diffs for a specific handful of files

If you're having trouble incorporating any of these into your workflow,
feel free to reach out and let me know! I'm happy to help.
