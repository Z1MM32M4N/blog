One thing I miss from being a teaching assistant is getting to write up
recitation and lecture notes for technical topics. Like with teaching
any other subject, writing up explanations for interesting things I've
found helps me round out what concepts are still confusing. I also miss
getting to make nice LaTeX-typeset PDFs.

Recitation notes are distinguished from normal blog posts in that
they'll cover more CS theory-oriented topics and will be more
*instructive* than *experience-based*. All recitation notes are tagged
with the tag `recitation`.

I might "cross post" a few of the more interesting existing recitation
handouts I've made over the years (though some of them make a
heavy-handed assumption that you're in the class currently).
