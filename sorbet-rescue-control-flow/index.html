<p>Sorbet thinks that <code>loop_count</code> has type
<code>NilClass</code> at the start of the <code>rescue</code> block,
which causes it to declare that the <code>puts</code> line is dead
(because <code>NilClass</code> is never truthy).</p>
<p>But why? Clearly, we can see that <code>loop_count</code> is an
<code>Integer</code>. We’d expect Sorbet to <em>at least</em> think
<code>loop_count</code> has type <code>T.nilable(Integer)</code>, if not
simply <code>Integer</code> outright.</p>
<p>When developing Sorbet, sometimes we choose an implementation because
it’s good enough, most of the time, but is simple to implement and/or
fast. Sorbet’s approach to <code>rescue</code> and exception handling is
one such choice.</p>
<h1 id="control-flow-and-rescue-in-sorbet">Control flow and
<code>rescue</code> in Sorbet</h1>
<p>I mentioned in <a href="/syntactic-control-flow/">my last post</a>
that Sorbet builds a <span class="smallcaps"><strong>control flow
graph</strong></span> (CFG) in order to model control-flow sensitive
types throughout the body of a method. But for <code>rescue</code>
nodes, it takes one of those “good enough, most of the time” shortcuts.
It pretends that there are only two jumps into the <code>rescue</code>
block: once before any <strong>any</strong> code in the
<code>begin</code> block has run, and once after <strong>all</strong>
the code in <code>begin</code> block has run:</p>

<p>This is a diagram of what a CFG in Sorbet mostly<span

class="sidenote">If you have <a
href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> installed, you can get Sorbet
to dump its internal CFG for a given file with the
<code>cfg-view.sh</code> script in the Sorbet repo. The CFG for the
example above looks like <a
href="/assets/img/rescue-example-01.svg">like this</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> looks like. The conditions for these jumps read from a
magical <code>&lt;exn-value&gt;</code> variable, which Sorbet treats as
<span class="smallcaps"><strong>unanalyzable</strong></span>: Sorbet
doesn’t attempt to track how the value is initialized nor how control
flow affects it. At any point it might be truthy or falsy, so Sorbet
will always assume both outcomes could happen.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we can explain the behavior in the example above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the first jump into the <code>rescue</code> block happens, the
<code>loop_count</code> variable is still uninitialized at that point,
and thus has type <code>NilClass</code> at that point.</li>
<li>The second jump into the <code>rescue</code> block happens after the
<code>begin</code> block finishes. But from Sorbet’s point of view, the
<code>begin</code> block never finishes: Sorbet sees the infinite
<code>while   true</code> loop and thinks that it’s impossible for
control to ever leave the <code>begin</code> block.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If you’re fearless, you can prove that this is what’s
happening in the <a href="/assets/img/rescue-example-01.svg">rendered
CFG</a> for the above example.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>That second point is <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/issues/4108">simply a bug</a>.
Sorbet should be smart enough to suspend the normal rules it applies
when processing code that infinitely loops (or unconditionally raises)
while checking code in a <code>begin</code> block that has a
<code>rescue</code>.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">easier said than done, lol<br />
<br />
</span></span> But still, fixing that bug would only make Sorbet think
that <code>loop_count</code> has type <code>T.nilable(Integer)</code> in
the <code>rescue</code> body—remember we said that ideally Sorbet would
know that <code>loop_count</code> is <strong>always</strong>
initialized, having type <code>Integer</code>.</p>
<p>So then, what is that weird jump to the <code>rescue</code> body
doing there? Intuitively, taking that branch means that the
<code>begin</code> block raised an exception <em>before ever running a
single line of code in the begin block</em>. To answer this, some
history.</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-rescue-in-sorbet">A brief history of
<code>rescue</code> in Sorbet</h1>
<p>Sorbet’s <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/commit/9189734a6c061071c3d3cd4398a5d7874a8c0c49">first
commit</a> dates to October 3, 2017. Six weeks later, the <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/commit/afb234741f4ccd98ca2903d1621746c64a2da5ab">initial
support for <code>rescue</code></a> landed. The pull request description
is from a time when all pull requests were Stripe-internal, so I’ll
quote it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This does most of the work in the CFG, preserving the semantics in
the desugarer. This is nice since we can treat these differently if we
want since we have the information this late.</p>
<p>It introduces a series of uncomputable <code>if</code>s since 0 or
more instructions from the first block will execute then one of the
<code>rescue</code>s could match and then if none do the
<code>else</code> will match. Check out the <code>.svg</code>s to see
the chaining.</p>
<p>If an invalid name is put in the exception expression, it will be
caught by the namer since the tree walk goes through them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that description only makes sense if you’re a Sorbet developer.
The approach it’s describing is what most people might do intuitively:
any instruction in a <code>begin</code> might raise, so record a jump
from each instruction in the <code>begin</code> block to the
<code>rescue</code> block. In picture form:</p>

<p>After the code at the start of the method, control flows immediately
to the first line of the <code>begin</code> body. But every line of the
<code>begin</code> body gets its own, tiny basic block with an
unanalyzable jump to the <code>rescue</code> block, or to the next line
of the body. On its own, this was probably enough to fix the bug in our
initial example—there would be a jump after the
<code>loop_count = 0</code> assignment into the <code>rescue</code>
block, so when merging all the previous environments, Sorbet would now
be able to see that <code>loop_count</code> is an
<code>Integer</code>.</p>
<p>But importantly, this original approach was thrown out. Which brings
us to our second point of history, when <a

</span></span> the “only before and after” approach arrived. In fact, a
comment from that commit persists unchanged in the codebase today:</p>

<p>If we just said that the original approach didn’t yield the bug in
our original example, why adopt this new approach?</p>
<p>For starters, the first approach had an even more insidious bug:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">begin</span></span>

<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">rescue</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="co"># Sorbet would assume `x` was always set</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">puts</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The original <code>rescue</code> implementation had a bit of an of
off-by-one error, where it would think that <code>x</code> (being an
assignment as the very first instruction) would be set unconditionally.
But if the initializer for <code>x</code> raises, it in fact
<strong>won’t</strong> be set in the <code>rescue</code> block. Checking
to see whether a variable you were hoping was set by a rescue block but
which might not actually be set is much more common in correct code than
asserting in the rescue block that something was for sure set.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">And intuitively there’s an easy workaround: if you
expect some variable to be unconditionally set, don’t set it in the
<code>begin</code> block, set it outside!<br />
<br />
</span></span> Even still: that problem on its own would have been easy
enough to fix, but there was a second problem: typechecking
performance.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why having lots of tiny basic blocks is
bad for performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s not just the number of basic blocks. Sorbet also had to
duplicate a bunch of setup code to make sure that those unanalyzable
<code>&lt;exn-value&gt;</code> variables actually existed in the CFG. So
the absolute number of instructions in the CFG was larger, too (versus
the same number of instructions, but just distributed to more basic
blocks).</p></li>
<li><p>When finalizing a CFG, Sorbet has to compute the variables that
each basic block reads and writes. The algorithms inside Sorbet to
compute which variables are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-variable_analysis">live</a> by
a given point scale poorly when there are lots of blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>When typechecking a method, every basic block in the CFG requires
its own <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/blob/master/infer/environment.h#L127"><code>Environment</code></a>
data structure, which maps variables to their types within that block.
Sorbet either has to allocate a separate <code>Environment</code> per
block (what it currently does) or incur complexity from making them <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a>. <a
href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/why-sorbet-is-fast/">Allocating is
slow</a> and we really like to avoid complexity.</p></li>
<li><p>Before typechecking a basic block, Sorbet has to merge the
environments of all blocks that can jump into it. Merging environments
involves doing slow type checking operations (checking whether two
possibly-arbitrary types are subtypes of each other).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The new “only before and after” approach is pretty clever. In
practice, it more or less models the “raise in first assignment” case
while generating far fewer basic blocks, thus running much faster.</p>
<h1 id="the-bigger-picture">The bigger picture</h1>
<p>There’s a lot of these clever “good enough” tricks in Sorbet. In a
sense, a lot of them are only possible because of the stakes: Sorbet
<em>already</em> allows <a
href="https://sorbet.org/docs/gradual"><code>T.untyped</code></a>, so
depending on your viewpoint, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is already the holy grail of all hacks in the type system, so
why not cut corners elsewhere when it makes sense.</li>
<li><em>Because</em> <code>T.untyped</code> is in the type system, at
least if there’s a bug in Sorbet the user can always work around it by
way of <code>T.untyped</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, in some sense the stakes are low. In a compiler where the
stakes for being wrong are higher (the code compute the wrong answer),
maybe shortcuts aren’t the best idea. And in fact, <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/2962">multiple</a> <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/3044">distinct</a> <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/4488">exception</a> <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/4531">changes</a> landed in
Sorbet’s CFG code to support the Sorbet Compiler.</p>
<p>It’s now been over four years since we shipped the change to model
<code>rescue</code> this way. I’m not aware of a single incident caused
by this bug, and I can only directly remember being asked why Sorbet has
behavior like this twice (and I read <em>a lot</em> of Sorbet
questions). I can’t find any performance numbers from when the original
change landed, but we can still put it into perspective: it’s the
difference between a handful of people being confused over the course of
4 years, or thousands of people getting faster typechecking results
thousands of times per day. Seems like a reasonable trade-off.</p>
<p>Though eventually it would be nice to at least fix <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/issues/4108">that earlier
bug</a>. 😅</p>
