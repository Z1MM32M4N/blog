for the Ruby VM&rsquo;s source code (in my case, in Vim). Here&rsquo;s how I did it!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve been making a point to learn more about <a href="/search-down-the-stack/">things I depend
on</a> recently. Today, that means learning about
Ruby. And what better way to learn than to check out the source code,
and jump around?</p>

<p><a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/">clangd</a> is an editor-agnostic language server that uses the <a href="https://langserver.org/">Language
Server Protocol</a> to power IDE-like features in
your preferred text editor. All it needs is a <code>compile_commands.json</code>,
which is basically a mapping of filename to options to pass to <code>clang</code>
so that it knows things like which warnings to enable and where to
search for header files.</p>

<p><a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/">clangd</a> works best for projects built using <code>cmake</code>, but the Ruby VM
doesn&rsquo;t use <code>cmake</code>. Regardless, we can make a <code>compile_commands.json</code>
file by using <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> to trace the execution of a Ruby build, and use the
trace information to write out a <code>compile_commands.json</code> file.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>I could only get these steps to work for Linux, as the Bear README
mentions that on macOS you have to disable System Integrity Protection
to get it to work.</p>

<h3>1. Install <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a></h3>

<p>I describe how I built Bear from source in the Appendix.</p>

<h3>2. Clone the Ruby source code.</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby
cd ruby
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Configure the Ruby build.</h3>

<p>We have to tell the <code>configure</code> script to use Clang to compile (or
if you&rsquo;re confident that your system compiler toolchain is Clang,
you can just run <code>./configure</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># Create the ./configure file
autoconf
# This only works when using clang to build Ruby
./configure CC=clang
</code></pre>

<h3>4. Use <code>bear</code> to invoke <code>make</code></h3>

<p>Bear will use a dynamically preloaded library to trace system calls
that exec <code>clang</code> processes, looking at things like the command line
arguments given to Clang.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bear make
</code></pre>

<h3>5. That&rsquo;s it!</h3>

<p>The output is <code>./compile_commands.json</code>, which should be non-empty. If
it&rsquo;s empty or just has <code>[]</code>, it didn&rsquo;t work. There&rsquo;s some
troubleshooting in the <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> README.</p>

<p>The <code>compile_commands.json</code> file will be consumed by <code>clangd</code> in your
editor. Check <a href="https://langserver.org">https://langserver.org</a> to find an LSP client for your
preferred editor, and follow its setup instructions.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built the <code>compile_commands.json</code> file and configured your
editor to use LSP with <code>clangd</code>, you should be able to do things like
Jump to Definition and Hover on the Ruby source code!</p>

<h2>Appendix: Building Bear from source</h2>

<p>This is probably common knowledge for people who use <code>cmake</code> regularly,
but this is how I built Bear from source, because I built it on a
machine where I didn&rsquo;t have root so I couldn&rsquo;t write to <code>/usr/local</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear
cd Bear
mkdir build
cd build

# Install to $HOME/.local/bin instead of /usr/local/bin
cmake .. "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local"
make -j$(nproc)
make install

# → $HOME/.local/bin/bear exists now
</code></pre>

<h2>Appendix: LSP in Neovim with LanguageClient-neovim</h2>

<p>I use Neovim. My preferred LSP client is <a href="https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim">LanguageClient-neovim</a>. Here&rsquo;s
the parts of my Neovim config files that setup <code>clangd</code>:</p>

    <id>https://blog.jez.io/cli-code-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I do the bulk of my code reviews from the command line, especially when
reviewing larger changes. I&rsquo;ve built up a number of tools and config
settings that help me dig into the nuances of the code I&rsquo;m reviewing, so
that I can understand it better than if I were just browsing online.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In particular, I&rsquo;ll walk through how I&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>check out the code in the first place,</li>
<li>get a feel for what changed,</li>
<li>visualize the relationships between the files that changed,</li>
<li>bring up the code diffs in Vim,</li>
<li>leverage the unique power of the editor and the terminal.</li>
</ul>


<p>But first, let&rsquo;s talk briefly about the point of code review in the
first place.</p>

<h2>Code review philosophy</h2>

<p>When I ask that other people review my code, it&rsquo;s an opportunity for me
to teach them about the change I&rsquo;ve just made. When I review someone
else&rsquo;s code, it&rsquo;s to learn something from them. Some other benefits of
code review include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Team awareness (to keep a pulse on what else is going on within your
team).</li>
<li>Finding alternative solutions (maybe there&rsquo;s a small change that lets
us kill two birds with one stone).</li>
</ul>


<p>If this is different from how you think about code review, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjmw9TRB7s">check out
this talk</a>. Code review is a powerful tool for
learning and growing a team.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s dive into the tools I use to maximize
benefit I get from code review.</p>

<h2>Checking out the code</h2>

<p>The first step to reviewing code in the terminal is to check out the
code in the first place. One option is to simply to <code>git pull</code> and then
<code>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</code>. But if you happen to be using GitHub, we can
get this down to just one command:</p>

<pre><code>hub pr checkout &lt;pr-number&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works using <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">hub</a>, which is a tool that exposes various features of
GitHub from the command line. If the pull request is from someone else&rsquo;s
fork, <code>hub</code> is even smart enough to add their fork as a remote and fetch
it.</p>

<h2>At first glance</h2>

<p>With the branch checked out locally, usually my next step is to get a
feel for what changed. For this, I&rsquo;ve written a git alias that shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>which files changed</li>
<li>how many lines changed in each file (additions and deletions)</li>
<li>how many lines changed overall</li>
</ul>


<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/git-stat.png"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/git-stat.png" title="git stat" ></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the definition of <code>git stat</code> from my <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">[alias]
    # list files which have changed since REVIEW_BASE
    # (REVIEW_BASE defaults to 'master' in my zshrc)
    files = !git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD \"$REVIEW_BASE\")

    # Same as above, but with a diff stat instead of just names
    # (better for interactive use)
    stat = !git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD \"$REVIEW_BASE\")
</code></pre>

<p>Under the hood, it just works using <code>git diff</code>, <code>git merge-base</code>, and a
personal environment variable <code>REVIEW_BASE</code>.</p>

<p><code>REVIEW_BASE</code> lets us choose which branch to review relative to. Most of
the time, <code>REVIEW_BASE</code> is <code>master</code>, but this isn&rsquo;t always the case! Some
repos branch off of <code>gh-pages</code>. Sometimes I like to review the most
recent commit as if it were its own branch.</p>

<p>To review the code relative so some other base, set <code>REVIEW_BASE</code> before
running <code>git stat</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># Review between 'gh-pages' and the current branch
REVIEW_BASE=gh-pages git stat

# Review changes made by the last commit of this branch:
REVIEW_BASE=HEAD^ git stat
</code></pre>

<p>I have <code>export REVIEW_BASE=master</code> in my <code>~/.bashrc</code>, because most
projects branch off of <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>Nothing too crazy yet&mdash;GitHub can already do everything we&rsquo;ve seen so
far. Let&rsquo;s start to up the ante.</p>

<h2>Visualizing file change frequency</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a short script that shows me a visualization of how
frequently the files involved in this branch change over time:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/git-heatmap.png"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/git-heatmap.png" title="git heatmap" ></a></p>

<p>This command identifies two main things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Files with lots of changes</strong>.</p>

<p>Files that have changed a lot in the past are likely to change in the
future. I review these files with an eye towards what the <em>next</em>
change will bring.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Is this change robust enough to still be useful in the future?
Will we throw this out soon after merging it?&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Files with few changes</strong>.</p>

<p>Files that aren&rsquo;t changed frequently are more likely to be brittle.
Alternatively, it&rsquo;s often the case that infrequently changed files
stay unchanged because the change is better made elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Does this change challenge an implicit assumption so that some other
part of the code was relying on? Is there a better place for this
change?&rdquo;</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Those two commands (<code>git stat</code> and <code>git heatmap</code>) are how I kick off my
code review: getting a birds-eye view of the change and some historical
context for what I&rsquo;m dealing with. Next, I drill down into the
relationships between the files that changed.</p>

<h2>Visualizing relationships between files</h2>

<p>At work I review JavaScript files, so I&rsquo;ve built out this next bit of
tooling specifically for JavaScript.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It helps to understand
which files import others, so I have a command that computes the
dependency graph of the files changed on this branch:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/git-depgraph.png"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/git-depgraph.png" title="git depgraph" ></a></p>

<p>This is where we start to see some distinct advantages over what GitHub
provides. As you see above, the <code>git depgraph</code> alias calculates the
dependency graph for files changed by this branch. Why is this useful?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Maybe we want to start reviewing from <code>Provider.js</code>, since it doesn&rsquo;t
depend on any other files that have changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe we want to work the other way: start with <code>Elements.js</code> so we
know the motivation for why <code>Provider.js</code> had to changed in the first
place.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In either case, we can see the structure of the change. Three files
depend on <code>Elements.js</code>, so it&rsquo;s serving the needs of many modules.
<code>Element.js</code> only has one dependency, etc. Each branch&rsquo;s dependency
graph shows different information; it can be surprising what turns up.</p>

<p>I have the <code>git depgraph</code> alias defined like this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">[alias]
    depgraph = !git madge image --webpack-config webpack.config.js --basedir . --style solarized-dark src
</code></pre>

<p>Some notes about this definition:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It depends on the <code>git-madge</code> command, which you can <a href="https://github.com/jez/git-madge">download
and install here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s using <em>this project&rsquo;s</em> <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, so I&rsquo;ve made
this alias local to the repo, rather than available globally.</p></li>
<li><p>It dumps the image to stdout. Above, we used iTerm2&rsquo;s <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html">imgcat</a>
program to pipe stdin and dump a raster image to the terminal.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use iTerm2 or don&rsquo;t want to install <code>imgcat</code>, you can
pipe it to Preview using open<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (<code>open -f -a Preview</code>) or just
redirect the PNG to a file.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>git depgraph</code> alias is a game changer. It makes it easier to get spun
up in new code bases, helps make sense of large changes, and just looks
plain cool. But at the end of the day, we came here to review some code,
so let&rsquo;s take a look at how we can actually view the diffs of the files
that changed.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the diffs</h2>

<p>To review the diffs, the simplest option is to just run <code>git diff
master..HEAD</code>. This has a bunch of downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No syntax highlighting (everything is either green or red).</p></li>
<li><p>No surrounding context (for example, GitHub lets you click to expand
lines above or below a diff hunk).</p></li>
<li><p>The diff is &ldquo;unified,&rdquo; instead of split into two columns.</p></li>
<li><p>No way to exclude a specific file (the 300 line diff to your
<code>yarn.lock</code> file is sometimes nice to hide).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My solution to all of these problems is to view the diffs in Vim, with
the help of two Vim plugins and two git aliases. Before we get to
that, here&rsquo;s a screenshot:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/git-review.png"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/git-review.png" title="git review" ></a></p>

<p>Looks pretty similar to GitHub&rsquo;s interface, with the added bonus that
it&rsquo;s using my favorite colorscheme! The Vim plugins featured are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">tpope/vim-fugitive</a> for showing the side-by-side diff (<code>:Gdiff</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter">airblade/vim-gitgutter</a> for showing the <code>+/-</code> signs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-colors-solarized">jez/vim-colors-solarized</a> for tweaking the diff highlight
colors.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>And to orchestrate the whole thing, I&rsquo;ve set up these two aliases:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">[alias]
  # NOTE: These aliases depend on the `git files` alias from
  # a few sections ago!

    # Open all files changed since REVIEW_BASE in Vim tabs
    # Then, run fugitive's :Gdiff in each tab, and finally
    # tell vim-gitgutter to show +/- for changes since REVIEW_BASE
    review = !vim -p $(git files) +\"tabdo Gdiff $REVIEW_BASE\" +\"let g:gitgutter_diff_base = '$REVIEW_BASE'\"

    # Same as the above, except specify names of files as arguments,
    # instead of opening all files:
    # git reviewone foo.js bar.js
    reviewone = !vim -p +\"tabdo Gdiff $REVIEW_BASE\" +\"let g:gitgutter_diff_base = '$REVIEW_BASE'\"
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how they work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>git review</code> opens each file changed by this branch as a tab in Vim.
Then <code>:Gdiff</code> from vim-fugitive shows the diff in each tab.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git reviewone</code> is like <code>git review</code>, but you specify which
files to open (in case you only want to diff a few).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Like with the <code>git stat</code> alias, these aliases respect the <code>REVIEW_BASE</code>
environment variable I&rsquo;ve set up in my <code>~/.bashrc</code>. (Scroll back up for
a refresher.) For example, to review all files relative to <code>master</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">REVIEW_BASE=master git review
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you might think that all we&rsquo;ve done is re-create the
GitHub code review experience in Vim. But actually what we&rsquo;ve done is so
much more powerful.</p>

<h2>Interactive Code Review</h2>

<p>When reviewing on GitHub, the code is completely static&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
change it. Also, because the code is coming from GitHub&rsquo;s servers,
it&rsquo;s laggy when you click around to view related files. By switching our
code review to the terminal, we can now edit files, jump to other files,
and run arbitrary commands at no cost.</p>

<p>It might not be obvious how huge of a win this is, so let&rsquo;s see some
examples. Take this screenshot of the <code>requireElement</code> function. It
moved from <em>above</em> the <code>findElement</code> function to <em>below</em> it (probably
because the former calls the latter):</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/requireElement01.png"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/requireElement01.png" title="diff" ></a></p>

<p>But is the location of the <code>requireElement</code> function the only thing
that&rsquo;s changed? By editing the file to move the function back to its
original location, vim-fugitive will automatically recompute the diff.
And in fact, we can see that the <em>type of the argument</em> has changed too,
from <code>string</code> to <code>ElementType</code>:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/requireElement02.png"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/requireElement02.png" title="diff" ></a></p>

<p>If we had been viewing this on GitHub, we might have taken for granted
that the function didn&rsquo;t change. But since we&rsquo;re in our editor, we can
interactively play around with our code and discover things we might
have missed otherwise. The advantages of interactive code review go well
beyond this example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a Flow project, we can ask for the type of a variable.</p></li>
<li><p>In a test file, we can change the test and see if it still passes or
if it now fails.</p></li>
<li><p>We can <code>grep</code> the project for all uses of a function (including files
<em>not</em> changed by this branch).</p></li>
<li><p>We can open up related files for cross-referencing.</p></li>
<li><p>We can run the code in a debugger and see how it behaves.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>By having the full power of our editor, we can literally retrace the
steps that the author went through to create the pull request. If our
goal is to understand and learn from code review, there&rsquo;s no better way
than walking in the author&rsquo;s shoes.</p>

<h2>Recap</h2>

<p>To recap, here&rsquo;s a list of the tools I use to review code at the command
line:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hub pr checkout</code></li>
<li><code>git stat</code> to list files that have changed</li>
<li><code>git heatmap</code> to show how frequently these files change</li>
<li><code>git depgraph</code> to show a graph of which files depend on which</li>
<li><code>git review</code> to open diffs of all the files in Vim</li>
<li><code>git reviewone</code> to open diffs for a specific handful of files</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble incorporating any of these into your workflow,
feel free to reach out and let me know! I&rsquo;m happy to help.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Configuring an editor for a new language is a double-edged sword: it&rsquo;s intensely
satisfying when done, but takes time away from diving into the language itself!
After using Haskell for a little over a year, I&rsquo;ve settled on a high-quality set
of editor plugins. They&rsquo;re simple, powerful, and all play nicely together.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.haskellstack.org/">Haskell Stack</a> exclusively. Stack&rsquo;s goal is reproducible builds,
which means that in general, things Just Work.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">Neovim</a>, rather than normal Vim. Usually, my justification
is ideological rather than technical. However, for Haskell my setup <strong>requires</strong>
Neovim. Fear not! Neovim is feature-packed and also very stable. I love Neovim,
and I&rsquo;ll be writing more about why in a future post.</p>

<p>By the way, new to Vim plugins? I happen to have <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">just the post for
you</a>!</p>

<!-- TODO(jez): Update with link to Neovim post -->


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to move in order of increasing complexity. That said, even the most
&ldquo;complex&rdquo; plugin here is actually quite painless to set up. By the end, we&rsquo;ll
have a complete development experience! Coming up:</p>

<ul>
<li>syntax highlighting &amp; indentation (<strong><a href="https://github.com/neovimhaskell/haskell-vim">haskell-vim</a></strong>)</li>
<li>auto-formatting &amp; style (<strong><a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hindent">hindent</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jaspervdj/stylish-haskell">stylish-haskell</a></strong>)</li>
<li>quickfix and sign column support (<strong>using <a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">ale</a></strong>) for:

<ul>
<li>linter style suggestions (<strong>hlint</strong>)</li>
<li>compiler errors and warnings (<strong>ghc-mod</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type inspection, REPL integration, and more! (<strong><a href="https://github.com/parsonsmatt/intero-neovim">intero-neovim</a></strong>)</li>
</ul>


<p>To keep things concise, I&rsquo;ve moved all the relevant configuration to the end of
the post. For now, let&rsquo;s start at the top.</p>

<!-- TODO(jez) Demonstrate everything with an asciicast -->


<h2>Syntax Highlighting &amp; Indentation</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/neovimhaskell/haskell-vim">haskell-vim</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>Vim&rsquo;s default Haskell filetype plugin is pretty lack luster. Everything is blue,
except for strings which are colored like comments, and keywords which are
colored like constants. Indentation is wonky in some cases, and isn&rsquo;t
configurable.</p>

<p>This plugin corrects all that. It&rsquo;s the filetype plugin for Haskell that
<strong>should</strong> ship with Vim.</p>

<p>Not only does it come with saner defaults, it also comes with more config
options, especially for indentation. This is important because it lets me
tweak the automatic indentation to my own personal style.</p>

<p>(Remember: all the config is at the end of the post.)</p>

<h2>Auto-formatting and Indentation</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/alx741/vim-hindent">vim-hindent</a></li>
<li><strong>Tool</strong>: <code>stack install hindent</code></li>
<li><strong>Tool</strong>: <code>stack install stylish-haskell</code></li>
</ul>


<p>For small projects, I have an idea of what style I like best. However, for
larger projects it&rsquo;s unfair to ask contributors that they learn the ins and outs
of my style. Situations like these call for automated solutions.</p>

<p><code>go fmt</code> famously solved this problem for Golang by building the formatting tool
into the compiler. For Haskell, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hindent">hindent</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. <code>hindent</code> can be
installed through Stack, and <code>vim-hindent</code> is a Vim plugin that shims it.</p>

<p>But I said I&rsquo;m partial to my own style in personal projects. There&rsquo;s another
Haskell formatter that&rsquo;s much less invasive: <a href="https://github.com/jaspervdj/stylish-haskell">stylish-haskell</a>. It basically
only reformats <code>import</code>s, <code>case</code> branches, and record fields, aligning them
vertically. And in fact, it&rsquo;s possible to use this alongside <code>hindent</code>.</p>

<p>With these three tools, I can pick the right tool for the job:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hand saw</strong>: let <code>haskell-vim</code> config control the indentation</li>
<li><strong>Table saw</strong>: run <code>stylish-haskell</code> only</li>
<li><strong>Chainsaw</strong>: run <code>hindent</code> only</li>
<li><strong>Chainsaw, then sand paper</strong>: run <code>hindent</code>, then <code>stylish-haskell</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Getting them to play together requires a bit of config, so I&rsquo;ve included mine at
the end of the post.</p>

<h2>Quickfix &amp; Sign Columns</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">ale</a></li>
<li><strong>Tool</strong>: <code>stack install hlint</code></li>
<li><strong>Tool</strong>: <code>stack build ghc-mod</code>

<ul>
<li>N.B.: This is <em>build</em> not <em>install</em> here<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This step requires <em>either</em> Neovim or Vim 8; ALE stands for &ldquo;Asynchronous Lint
Engine,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s using the new asynchronous job control features of these two
editors. It&rsquo;s like an asynchronous Syntastic<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>ALE ships with a number of Haskell integrations by default. For example, it can
show errors if only Stack is installed. I prefer enabling two of ALE&rsquo;s Haskell
integrations: <code>hlint</code> and <code>ghc-mod</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hlint</code> is a linter for Haskell. It warns me when I try to do silly things
like <code>if x then True else False</code>.</li>
<li><code>ghc-mod</code> is a tool that can check files for compiler errors.</li>
</ul>


<p>The beauty of ALE is that it works almost entirely out of the box. The only real
setup is to tell ALE to use only these two integrations explicitly. I&rsquo;ve
included the one-liner to do this in the config at the bottom.</p>

<h2>Intero: The Pièce de Résistance</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/parsonsmatt/intero-neovim">intero-neovim</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Intero is a complete development program for Haskell. It started as an Emacs
package, but has been ported almost entirely to Neovim. Probably the best way to
introduce it is with this asciicast:</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/128416">
    <img
      width="700px"
      alt="Intero for Neovim asciicast"
      src="https://asciinema.org/a/128416.png">
  </a>
</p>


<p>Intero is designed for stack, sets itself up automatically, has point-and-click
type information, and lets me jump to identifier definitions. On top of it all,
it uses Neovim to communicate back and forth with a terminal buffer so that I
get a GHCi buffer <strong>right inside Neovim</strong>. For Emacs users, this is nothing new
I&rsquo;m sure. But having the REPL in my editor continues to blow my mind 😮.</p>

<p>Developing with the REPL in mind helps me write better code. Only top-level
bindings are exposed in the REPL, so I write more small, testable functions.
See here for more reasons <a href="http://chrisdone.com/posts/haskell-repl">why the REPL is awesome</a>.</p>

<p>On top of providing access to the REPL, Intero provides about a dozen
convenience commands that shell out to the REPL backend asynchronously. Being
able to reload my code in the REPL&mdash;from Vim, with a single keystroke!&mdash;is a
huge boon when developing.</p>

<p>Intero takes a little getting used to, so be sure to read the docs for some
sample workflows. Intero also sets up no mappings by default, so I&rsquo;ve included
my settings below.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>With these tools, I feel empowered (rather than hindered) when I sit down to
work with Haskell.</p>

<ul>
<li>The entire setup uses Stack, so things Just Work.

<ul>
<li>As a consequence, everything works with the implicit global Stack project!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It scales up in power:

<ul>
<li>From simple syntax highlighting and manual indentation&hellip;</li>
<li>to an indentation chainsaw and a <strong>REPL embeded in the editor</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I can take full advantage of all my tools working together, leading to cleaner
code and fewer frustrations.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now that I&rsquo;m finally at a point where I can stop fretting about my Haskell
setup, I&rsquo;ll have more time to explore the language and write about my
experience.</p>

<p>Haskell-the-language isn&rsquo;t quite on the same level as SML-the-language, but it&rsquo;s
far and above when comparing by tooling support. I&rsquo;m looking forward to taking
advantage of that!</p>

    <updated>2017-02-26T21:26:53-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/reach-for-markdown</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve written <a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">in the past</a> (<a href="/2015/01/10/offline-latex-development-part-2/">twice</a>) about how to
streamline the writing process when using LaTeX. Since then, I&rsquo;ve found that I
enjoy writing even more when I don&rsquo;t have to reach for LaTeX at all. By reaching
first for Markdown, then for LaTeX when necessary, writing is easier and more
enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Writing at the Command Line</h2>

<p>Last year, I <a href="https://jez.io/talks/writing-at-the-command-line/">gave a talk</a> about the merits of writing primarily at
the command line. My main claims were that when writing we want:</p>

<ul>
<li>an open document format (so that our writings are future proof)</li>
<li>to be using open source software (for considerations of privacy and cost)</li>
<li>to optimize for the &ldquo;common case&rdquo;</li>
<li>to be able to write for print and digital (PDFs, web pages, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Markdown solves these constraints nicely:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a plain text format&mdash;plain text has been around for decades and will
be for decades more.</li>
<li>Given a plain text format, we can bring our own text editor.</li>
<li>Plenty of open source programs manipulate Markdown.</li>
<li>When we need advanced features, we can mix LaTeX into our Markdown documents.</li>
</ul>


<p>For those unfamiliar with Markdown, it&rsquo;s super quick to pick up. If you only
look at one guide, see this one:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">CommonMark</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to start comparing features available in certain implementations of
Markdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown.pl</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc Markdown</a></li>
</ul>


<p>For more on why you should want to be writing at the command line, you can
<a href="https://jez.io/talks/writing-at-the-command-line/">check out the talk slides</a>.</p>

<h2>Pandoc Starter</h2>

<p>The central tool I spoke about in <em>Writing at the Command Line</em> is <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>.
Pandoc is an amazingly simple command line program that takes in Markdown files
and spits out really anything you can think of.</p>

<p>To make using Pandoc even easier than it already is, I put together a
<a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter">collection of starter templates</a>. They&rsquo;re all available <a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter">on
Github</a> if you&rsquo;d prefer to dive right in.</p>

<p>There are currently six different templates, specialized for the kind of
document you&rsquo;d like to create. Each has a <code>README</code> for installation and usage
instructions, as well as a <code>Makefile</code> for invoking <code>pandoc</code> correctly.</p>

<p>All the templates generate PDFs from Markdown by way of LaTeX. In addition to
Pandoc, you&rsquo;ll also need LaTeX installed locally.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/tree/master/article"><code>article</code></a></h3>

<p>This template uses the standard LaTeX <code>article</code> document class. It&rsquo;s a
no frills, no nonsense choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/blob/master/article/src/sample.pdf"><img src="/images/pandoc-starter-article.png" alt="article template" /></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/tree/master/tufte-handout"><code>tufte-handout</code></a></h3>

<p>As an alternative to the <code>article</code> document class, there&rsquo;s also the
<code>tufte-handout</code> document class. It originates from the style Edward Tufte
popularized in his books and articles on visualization and design.</p>

<p>Apart from a different font (it uses Palatino instead of the default Computer
Modern), this template features the ability add side notes to your documents. I
often find myself reaching for this template when I want to disguise the fact
that I&rsquo;m secretly using LaTeX.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/blob/master/tufte-handout/src/sample.pdf"><img src="/images/pandoc-starter-tufte-handout.png" alt="tufte-handout template" /></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/tree/master/homework"><code>homework</code></a></h3>

<p>A second alternative to the <code>article</code> document class is the <code>homework</code> document
class. It works nicely for homework assignments and problem sets. The class
itself has a number of handy features, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>the option to put your name on every page, or only on the first page</li>
<li>an option to use wide or narrow margins</li>
<li>most of the AMS Math packages you&rsquo;d include in the process of typesetting a
math assignment</li>
<li>a convenient environment for typesetting induction proofs</li>
</ul>


<p>For more features and usage information, check out <a href="/2015/01/10/the-latex-homework-document-class/">this blog post</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jez/latex-homework-class">the source</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/blob/master/homework/src/sample.pdf"><img src="/images/pandoc-starter-homework.png" alt="homework template" /></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/tree/master/beamer"><code>beamer</code></a></h3>

<p>LaTeX provides the <code>beamer</code> document class for creating slides; this template
makes it even easier to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a new slide with a &ldquo;<code>##</code>&rdquo; header</li>
<li>Make a section divider with a &ldquo;<code>#</code>&rdquo; header</li>
<li>Mix lists, links, code, and other Markdown features you&rsquo;re familiar with to
create the content for a slide.</li>
</ul>


<p>So basically, just write the outline for your talk, and Pandoc takes care of
making the slides&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t get much simpler.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/blob/master/beamer/src/sample.pdf"><img src="/images/pandoc-starter-beamer.png" alt="beamer template" /></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/tree/master/beamer-solarized"><code>beamer-solarized</code></a></h3>

<p>The default beamer styles are pretty boring. To add a bit of flair and
personality to my slide decks, I made a Solarized theme for beamer.</p>

<p>In addition to the screenshot below, the <a href="https://jez.io/talks/writing-at-the-command-line/">Writing at the Command
Line</a> slides I linked to earlier also use this theme, if you want
to see a less contrived example.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/blob/master/beamer-solarized/src/sample.pdf"><img src="/images/pandoc-starter-beamer-solarized.png" alt="beamer solarized template" /></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/tree/master/book-writeup"><code>book-writeup</code></a></h3>

<p>Finally, sometimes a simple article or slide deck doesn&rsquo;t cut it. Usually this
means I&rsquo;d like to group the writing into chapters. This template makes writing a
chapter as easy as using a &ldquo;<code>#</code>&rdquo; Markdown header.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter/blob/master/book-writeup/src/sample.pdf"><img src="/images/pandoc-starter-book-writeup.png" alt="book writeup template" /></a></p>

<h2>Writing Plugins for Vim</h2>

<p>If you happen to use Vim, I&rsquo;d highly recommend installing <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim">goyo.vim</a> for
writing. It removes all the visual frills Vim includes to make writing code
easier so you can focus on your writing without distractions.</p>

<p>I also really enjoy <a href="https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc">vim-pandoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax">vim-pandoc-syntax</a>. They&rsquo;re a pair of
complementary plugins for highlighting and working with Pandoc Markdown-flavored
documents. They work so well that I use them for Markdown documents even when
not using Pandoc.</p>

<h2>Reach for Markdown</h2>

<p>Writing should be a pleasant experience. With the right tools, it can be. LaTeX
is powerful but cumbersome to use. With Markdown, we can focus on our writing,
and worry about the presentation later. Pandoc can take care of the presentation
for us, so the <a href="https://github.com/jez/pandoc-starter">only thing left to do is start</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Troubleshooting Haskell Stack Setup on OS X]]></title>
    <link href="https://blog.jez.io/troubleshooting-haskell-stack-setup-on-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-02T21:04:08-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/troubleshooting-haskell-stack-setup-on-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Diehl&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html">Vim and Haskell in 2016</a> does a great
job of outlining the quickest way to get a quality Haskell development
experience. I ran into a simple issue when I followed it due to a bit of an
idiosyncrasy on OS X El Capitan. I also document a few of the extra steps I took
which aren&rsquo;t mentioned explicitly in his original article.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This post wouldn&rsquo;t actually be necessary if it weren&rsquo;t for one thing: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899">System
Integrity Protection</a> in OS X El Capitan, also known as &ldquo;rootless&rdquo;
mode. It affects Haskell&rsquo;s build and install step in a subtle (but solved) way,
and the rest of the article will cover what to watch out for when installing on
OS X.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t follow these instructions and you&rsquo;re on OS X El Capitan, you&rsquo;ll
likely run into an issue that looks like <code>/usr/bin/ar: permission denied</code>. The
Stack installation instructions call this out specifically:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are on OS X 10.11 (&ldquo;El Capitan&rdquo;) or later, GHC 7.8.4 is incompatible
with System Integrity Protection (a.k.a. &ldquo;rootless&rdquo;). GHC 7.10.2 includes a
fix, so this only affects users of GHC 7.8.4.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the risk of spoiling the surprise, we&rsquo;re going to set up Stack while taking
care to make sure that we get GHC >= 7.10. So let&rsquo;s do just that!</p>

<h2>Environment Prep (optional)</h2>

<p>Note that this step is optional and has nothing to do with OS X; I just wanted
to point it out quickly.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html#dev-environment">Dev Environment</a> on <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html">Vim and Haskell in
2016</a>, Stephen Diehl writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Times have changed quite a bit, and the new preferred way of installing GHC in
2016 is to forgo using the system package manager for installing ghc and use
Stack to manage the path to the compiler executable and sandboxes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stack stores it&rsquo;s metadata in the <code>~/.stack</code> folder by default. If you&rsquo;re not a
huge fan of things cluttering up your home folder, set the <code>STACK_ROOT</code> variable
in you bashrc or zshrc:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Set STACK_ROOT to avoid clutter">export XDG_DATA_HOME="$HOME/.local/share"

# Have Haskell Stack use XDG Base Directory spec
export STACK_ROOT="$XDG_DATA_HOME/stack"
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the choice of location is up to you. In particular I&rsquo;ve chosen to
adhere to the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support">XDG Base Directory specification</a> here, which you may want
to take a peek at if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar. That&rsquo;s why you see references to
<code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure you restart your terminal to pick up the new variables before
continuing.</p>

<h2>Install Stack from Homebrew</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll want to take a second to purge anything
Haskell-related from previous botched setup attempts:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Wipe the slate clean"># If you had GHC installed
$ brew uninstall ghc

# If you tried and failed at installing Stack already
$ brew uninstall haskell-stack
$ rm -r ~/.stack
# If you happened to also set STACK_ROOT
$ rm -r $STACK_ROOT
</code></pre>

<p>With that out of the way, we can actually get our hands on Stack. For OS X,
we&rsquo;ll install through Homebrew:</p>

<pre><code class="console Install Stack">$ brew install haskell-stack
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure Stack, avoiding &ldquo;rootless&rdquo; issues</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the trick. We need to run <code>stack setup</code> for the first time to let Stack
configure itself. But remember: we want to make sure that Stack doesn&rsquo;t set
itself up with version 7.8.4 of GHC. We can get around this by specifying an
explicit resolver to the <code>stack</code> command (you can find more information on
&ldquo;resolvers&rdquo; elsewhere):</p>

<pre><code class="bash Side-step rootless issue in setup"># Change the resolver to the most up-to-date one. This is a hack to ensure that
# get GHC version &gt; 7.8, because there's an issue with El Capitan's rootless
# mode.
stack --resolver=lts-6.10 setup
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice we use the <code>--resolver=...</code> flag to force Stack to use a specific
resolver. This post will be out of date as soon as it&rsquo;s written, so check
<a href="https://www.stackage.org/snapshots">Stackage</a> to find the latest LTS snapshot.</p>

<h2>Return to Vim and Haskell in 2016</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the environment setup! Now you&rsquo;ll want to turn your attention to
configuring Vim.</p>

<p>The steps to set up Vim are platform independent, so now that we&rsquo;ve set up Stack
correctly, you can head over to <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html">Vim and Haskell in 2016</a> to
finish things out.</p>
