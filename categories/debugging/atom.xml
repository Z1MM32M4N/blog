for the Ruby VM&rsquo;s source code (in my case, in Vim). Here&rsquo;s how I did it!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve been making a point to learn more about <a href="/search-down-the-stack/">things I depend
on</a> recently. Today, that means learning about
Ruby. And what better way to learn than to check out the source code,
and jump around?</p>

<p><a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/">clangd</a> is an editor-agnostic language server that uses the <a href="https://langserver.org/">Language
Server Protocol</a> to power IDE-like features in
your preferred text editor. All it needs is a <code>compile_commands.json</code>,
which is basically a mapping of filename to options to pass to <code>clang</code>
so that it knows things like which warnings to enable and where to
search for header files.</p>

<p><a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/">clangd</a> works best for projects built using <code>cmake</code>, but the Ruby VM
doesn&rsquo;t use <code>cmake</code>. Regardless, we can make a <code>compile_commands.json</code>
file by using <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> to trace the execution of a Ruby build, and use the
trace information to write out a <code>compile_commands.json</code> file.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>I could only get these steps to work for Linux, as the Bear README
mentions that on macOS you have to disable System Integrity Protection
to get it to work.</p>

<h3>1. Install <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a></h3>

<p>I describe how I built Bear from source in the Appendix.</p>

<h3>2. Clone the Ruby source code.</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby
cd ruby
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Configure the Ruby build.</h3>

<p>We have to tell the <code>configure</code> script to use Clang to compile (or
if you&rsquo;re confident that your system compiler toolchain is Clang,
you can just run <code>./configure</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># Create the ./configure file
autoconf
# This only works when using clang to build Ruby
./configure CC=clang
</code></pre>

<h3>4. Use <code>bear</code> to invoke <code>make</code></h3>

<p>Bear will use a dynamically preloaded library to trace system calls
that exec <code>clang</code> processes, looking at things like the command line
arguments given to Clang.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bear make
</code></pre>

<h3>5. That&rsquo;s it!</h3>

<p>The output is <code>./compile_commands.json</code>, which should be non-empty. If
it&rsquo;s empty or just has <code>[]</code>, it didn&rsquo;t work. There&rsquo;s some
troubleshooting in the <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> README.</p>

<p>The <code>compile_commands.json</code> file will be consumed by <code>clangd</code> in your
editor. Check <a href="https://langserver.org">https://langserver.org</a> to find an LSP client for your
preferred editor, and follow its setup instructions.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built the <code>compile_commands.json</code> file and configured your
editor to use LSP with <code>clangd</code>, you should be able to do things like
Jump to Definition and Hover on the Ruby source code!</p>

<h2>Appendix: Building Bear from source</h2>

<p>This is probably common knowledge for people who use <code>cmake</code> regularly,
but this is how I built Bear from source, because I built it on a
machine where I didn&rsquo;t have root so I couldn&rsquo;t write to <code>/usr/local</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear
cd Bear
mkdir build
cd build

# Install to $HOME/.local/bin instead of /usr/local/bin
cmake .. "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local"
make -j$(nproc)
make install

# ‚Üí $HOME/.local/bin/bear exists now
</code></pre>

<h2>Appendix: LSP in Neovim with LanguageClient-neovim</h2>

<p>I use Neovim. My preferred LSP client is <a href="https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim">LanguageClient-neovim</a>. Here&rsquo;s
the parts of my Neovim config files that setup <code>clangd</code>:</p>

    <link href="https://blog.jez.io/search-down-the-stack/"/>
    <updated>2020-06-06T19:08:20-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/search-down-the-stack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve found it useful to search though the source code of things lower in
the stack lately. For example I saw an error something like this at work
recently:</p>

<pre><code>‚ùØ rake test
symbol lookup error: /home/jez/.../foo.so: undefined symbol bar
</code></pre>

<p>I was pretty confused. Modulo the names of commands and files, this was
pretty much all the output.</p>

<p>So I started searching. First I searched through my codebase for
<code>"symbol lookup error"</code>, but found nothing. Surely that string exists
somewhere. That must mean it&rsquo;s coming from lower in the stack?</p>

<p>The next level lower would mean third party Ruby gems. At work we use
Bundler <a href="https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/deploying.html#manual-deployment">in a mode</a> where it installs all gems into a single
convenient folder in the current directory: <code>./vendor/bundle/</code>. But a
search in that folder turned up nothing again. So&hellip; further down?</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s not from the app, and not from the gems, then maybe it&rsquo;s in Ruby
itself? I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby source</a>, checked out the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/v2_6_5">version tag</a> for
the Ruby version we&rsquo;re running, and searched for <code>"symbol lookup error"</code>
once again. And again nothing!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still plenty of layers below us, so let&rsquo;s keep peeling them
back. Ruby is written in C, which means we should check libc next (the C
standard library). There are multiple libc implementations, but I was
running this on Linux, so let&rsquo;s check GNU libc (glibc). glibc is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/sources.html">isn&rsquo;t
on GitHub</a>, but that&rsquo;s not a huge deterrant. Here&rsquo;s the search:</p>

<pre><code>‚ùØ rg -t c 'symbol lookup error'
dl-lookup.c
876:      _dl_signal_cexception (0, &amp;exception, N_("symbol lookup error"));
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a smoking gun! After all those layers, we found our
error message in libc itself. (This gave me a lot of leads on the problem
at hand, e.g., I had definitely ruled out a problem in my app or its
dependencies, and I was thinking, &ldquo;probably something is wrong about
how <code>foo.so</code> was compiled.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a fun story here about how Ruby C
extensions work, but that&rsquo;s a <a href="/linkers-ruby-c-exts/">tangent for another time</a>.)</p>

<p>My point is that <a href="https://livegrep.com/search/linux">searching all the code</a> is a super power, and it
applies to more than just searching the code we&rsquo;ve written. What a
blessing that the tools we&rsquo;re building on, like Ruby and GNU libc, are
all open source!</p>

<p>The next time it looks like a problem is outside the scope of your app&rsquo;s
code, maybe try searching the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>inside your gems or packages!</li>
<li>inside your language&rsquo;s standard library!

<ul>
<li>Some IDEs will even let you jump-to-def into core libraries üòÆ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inside your language&rsquo;s runtime

<ul>
<li>(if you&rsquo;re using a language with a runtime like Ruby or Python or
even <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8">JavaScript</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>powering your operating system kernel! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>For me, I&rsquo;ve already noticed it help save me time and give me more
context when I&rsquo;m debugging.</p>

<p>This might sound daunting, but sometimes it can be useful. A good thing to keep in mind: every <strong>system call</strong> like <code>open(2)</code> or <code>write(2)</code> or <code>select(2)</code> (and every other function from section 2 of the man pages) is really just a way for your program to request that the operating system do something; knowing that can be a decent place to start traipsing through code in the operating system.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
