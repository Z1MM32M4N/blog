I find that the easiest way to work with [Bazel] is with [fzf].

If you haven't already discovered fzf, it's great. It's a command-line fuzzy finder, which
means you can use it to replace tab completion at the command line with a fuzzy drop-down
picker. It's straight magic, it's quick to set up, and you're in for a treat.

[Install fzf â†’][fzf]

One of the best parts of fzf is that you can script it.[^kill] In the screen cast above,
you see how I'm using `**<TAB>` to trigger fzf to list all bazel targets. It uses the
[Custom fuzzy completion][api] API to register a shell function to run on `TAB`.

[^kill]:
  {-} Fun fzf tip: the `kill` command is already configured using this completion API: try
  typing `kill -p **<TAB>` and you'll never see `kill` the same way again ðŸ™‚

Here's the code you can add to your config files (like your `~/.zshrc`):

[^bash]

<figure>
```{.zsh .numberLines .hl-1 .hl-6}
_fzf_complete_bazel_test() {
  _fzf_complete '-m' "$@" < <(command bazel query \
    "kind('(test|test_suite) rule', //...)" 2> /dev/null)
}

_fzf_complete_bazel() {
  local tokens
  tokens=(${(z)LBUFFER})

  if [ ${#tokens[@]} -ge 3 ] && [ "${tokens[2]}" = "test" ]; then
    _fzf_complete_bazel_test "$@"
  else
    # Might be able to make this better someday, by listing all repositories
    # that have been configured in a WORKSPACE.
    # See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46229831/ or just run
    #     bazel query //external:all
    # This is the reason why things like @ruby_2_6//:ruby.tar.gz don't show up
    # in the output: they're not a dep of anything in //..., but they are deps
    # of @ruby_2_6//...
    _fzf_complete '-m' "$@" < <(command bazel query --keep_going \
      --noshow_progress \
      "kind('(binary rule)|(generated file)', deps(//...))" 2> /dev/null)
  fi
}
```

[^bash]:
  {-} Note: zsh automatically discovers these functions based on their name. But if you're
  using Bash, you need [a few extra lines][api] to register these functions.

At its core, these functions invoke `bazel query` to list all the targets, and then pass
the output to `fzf` so they can be filtered.

There's special handling for `bazel` (which is usually `bazel build`) as well as `bazel
test` (which limits the output to only `test` and `test_suite` targets).

You can see one caveat in the comment there:[^caveat] it doesn't do all that well at
finding every external target. For example, the Sorbet repo has a bunch of `:ruby.tar.gz`
defined in various external (`@`-prefixed) repository rules, but since Bazel doesn't have
an easy way to list all those external repos, and because they're not transitive deps of
anything in `//...`, they don't show up in the output.

[^caveat]:
  {-} If you have a solution to this, please let me know!

One last trick: I have a _ton_ of [bazel shell aliases][aliases]. Because of how zsh
auto-discovers these two `_fzf_complete_*` functions, using if the first token isn't
literally `bazel` then zsh won't find the right methods.

That's easy enough to fix: just have one more function per alias:

<figure>
```zsh
_fzf_complete_sb() { _fzf_complete_bazel "$@" }
_fzf_complete_sbg() { _fzf_complete_bazel "$@" }
_fzf_complete_sbgo() { _fzf_complete_bazel "$@" }
_fzf_complete_sbo() { _fzf_complete_bazel "$@" }
_fzf_complete_sbr() { _fzf_complete_bazel "$@" }
_fzf_complete_sbl() { _fzf_complete_bazel "$@" }
_fzf_complete_st() { _fzf_complete_bazel_test "$@" }
_fzf_complete_sto() { _fzf_complete_bazel_test "$@" }
_fzf_complete_stg() { _fzf_complete_bazel_test "$@" }
_fzf_complete_stog() { _fzf_complete_bazel_test "$@" }
```

And that about sums it up. If you have tips for how I could improve these functions,
please let me know!
