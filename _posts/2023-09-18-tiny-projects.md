It's easy for teams to find themselves only working on large projects. Large projects are
easier to sell ("this will generate _millions of dollars of revenue_ for our company!")
and easier to deflect when things get behind schedule ("we're behind on this milestone,
but that's okay _because this project is fundamentally hard_"). They come with more
opportunities to impress people and tend to be the projects people find themselves getting
promoted because of.

Sure, that's all fine, I get it. Just just want to tell you that it's okay to work on tiny
projects, too.

<!-- more -->

If the most important thing to be working on is actually just a laundry list of tasks,
that's okay! You don't need to come up with some "overarching narrative" for your
glorified list of tasks, complete with a project brief, key deliverables, architecture
review, yada yada yada. Just sit down, fix the task, and move onto the next one.

As long as the tiny projects _are as important as you think_, you don't need to kick them
down the road in search of a big project.

The only thing I'd add: this doesn't just apply to FOSS maintainers! All infrastructure
teams, even internal ones, benefit from focusing on the small tasks, the tiny projects,
etc.

On a more personal note, I've noticed that the parts of my career where it seemed like we
were pursuing novelty for novelty's sake was **also** the time when I felt the least
fulfilled and the least [energized] in my work. On the other hand, when I'm working
back-to-back on lots of tiny projects, I find myself building up momentum and staying "in
the zone" far more easily than I do when I'm only carving out time for one tiny project in
the gap between large projects.

I will say that I do happen to work on a project where the small projects are also _very_
user visible—that's not always the case. So it means that it's frequently the users
complaining about the tiny projects going undone, and it's also easy to rack up karma with
the users from checking them off. It's not going to shake out like that for all teams nor
all products.

But it's worth at least thinking about it. You don't always have to chase novelty: it's
okay to work on tiny projects too.
