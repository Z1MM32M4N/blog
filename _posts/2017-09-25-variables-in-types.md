These are some recitation notes for an ad-hoc recitation I gave for the
class [15-312 Principles of Programming Languages][ppl]. It was probably
my favorite 312 recitation content-wise, because it's the first
recitation where we've covered enough stuff to where we can really start
connecting the dots.
