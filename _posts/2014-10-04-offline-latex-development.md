While online clients like ShareLaTeX or writeLaTeX are popular for getting
started with LaTeX quickly, developing LaTeX locally with Vim and the command
line is my preferred LaTeX workflow. In this post, I'll describe the changes
I've made that make working with LaTeX on the command line a seamless
experience.

# Install LaTeX

Obviously, to work with LaTeX locally, you'll need LaTeX installed. To check if
you already have it installed, you can run `which pdflatex`. If it's installed,
this command will tell you the path to program. Otherwise, it won't print
anything.

## On Linux

Installing LaTeX on Linux isn't too bad. Usually it's included in your
distribution's package manager. I'll be focusing on OS X for the majority of
this post though, so Google around if you end up having trouble.

## On OS X

To install LaTeX on a Mac, we'll be installing MacTeX, which includes the
command line LaTeX utilities as well as a couple graphical clients for LaTeX
development. You can try compiling from source, but as Homebrew points out when
you try to `brew install latex`:

```plain
$ brew install latex
Error: No available formula for latex
Installing TeX from source is weird and gross, requires a lot of patches,
and only builds 32-bit (and thus can't use Homebrew deps on Snow Leopard.)

We recommend using a MacTeX distribution: http://www.tug.org/mactex/
```

With that in mind, head on over to
[http://www.tug.org/mactex/](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) and download the file
`MacTeX.pkg `. Once this has downloaded and you've clicked through the
installer, you should be ready to go with LaTeX. Verify this by running `which
pdflatex` again.

# Use Vim

The biggest productivity improvement you gain from developing LaTeX locally is
that you get to use Vim. Make sure you have a nice colorscheme for both your
terminal and for Vim. __I can't stress enough how important it is to make your
terminal look nice__: you want to enjoy your terminal experience, and this is
one of the easiest ways to do so.

# Use Make

Compiling LaTeX is pretty straightforward. To generate a PDF, all you have to do
is run the command

```bash
$ pdflatex <myfile>.tex
```

and you'll get a file called `<myfile>.pdf` in the current directory, plus some
intermediate files. We can go one step further and put a bunch of useful build
targets into a Makefile and use it to build our PDF:

<figure>

```{.make .numberLines}
# NOTE: Change "written" to the name of your TeX file with no extension
TARGET=written

all: $(TARGET).pdf

# Generalized rule: how to build a .pdf from each .tex
LATEXPDFS=$(patsubst %.tex,%.pdf,$(wildcard *.tex))
$(LATEXPDFS): %.pdf: %.tex
  pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode $(patsubst %.pdf,%.tex,$@)

clean:
  rm *.aux *.log || true

veryclean: clean
  rm $(TARGET).pdf

view: $(TARGET).pdf
  if [ "Darwin" = "$(shell uname)" ]; then open $(TARGET).pdf ; else evince $(TARGET).pdf ; fi

submit: $(TARGET).pdf
  cp $(TARGET).pdf ../

print: $(TARGET).pdf
  lpr $(TARGET).pdf

.PHONY: all clean veryclean view print
```

</figure>

If you save this to a file called `Makefile` in the same directory as your LaTeX
file, we can just run `make` instead of running `pdflatex <myfile>.tex`!

As you can see, there are a bunch of other handy targets here:

- `make clean` will remove all intermediate files that are created.
- `make veryclean` will remove all intermediate files and the compiled PDF file.
- `make view` will compile the file and then open it up in a PDF viewer (if
  you're on OS X, or on Linux and have `evince` installed).
- `make print` will send your document to the default printer with the default
  options for that printer.
- `make submit` will copy your file into the parent directory. This is handy
  when you're working in a subfolder on an assignment to isolate the
  intermediate files, but your class has provided a handin script that needs the
  PDF file to be in the parent directory.

# Workflow Tips

Right now, our workflow looks like this:

- Create TeX file
- Edit in Vim
- Switch to terminal
- Run make view to compile and view

We can actually optimize this workflow to one less step: we don't have to get
out of Vim to run make!

Vim has a command `:make` that will look for a Makefile in the current directory
and run it's `all` target. It also takes a target as an optional argument, so we
can do `:make view` to compile and view the document from within Vim!

Taking this one step further, we can add a command to shorten this. If we add

<figure>

```{.vim .numberLines}
command WV w | make view
```

<figcaption>Save, Compile and View in Vim</figcaption>
</figure>

to our `.vimrc`, we'll only have to type `:WV` to save, compile, and view our
PDF output.

# Wrap Up

That's it! I like this experience for a bunch of reasons:

- __It's faster__. Compiling LaTeX without having to wait for a web client to
  load is really nice.
- __It's more stable__. You can still edit, compile, and view your work if you
  don't have access to the Internet.
- __It's faster__. Using Vim to edit text is much more convenient than a
  standard text editor.

Do you have a LaTeX tip, a fancier Makefile, or a favorite vim plugin for LaTeX?
