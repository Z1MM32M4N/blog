Here's a fun bug in Sorbet:

<figure class="left-align-caption">

```{.ruby .numberLines .hl-11 .hl-12}

  begin
    loop_count = 0

    while true
      sleep(1)
      loop_count += 1
    end
  rescue Interrupt
    if loop_count
      puts("Looped #{loop_count} times")
    # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ error: This code is unreachable
    end
  end
end
```

Sorbet thinks that `loop_count` is `nil` at the start of the `rescue` block, which causes it to
declare the `puts` line unreachable (because `nil` is never truthy).

But why? Clearly we can see that `loop_count` is an `Integer`. We'd expect Sorbet to _at
least_ think `loop_count` has type `T.nilable(Integer)`, if not simply `Integer` outright.

Sometimes Sorbet takes shortcutsâ€”especially when the short cut is good enough 99% of the time
while being simple and fast. Sorbet's approach to `rescue` and exception handling is one
of these shortcuts.

# Control flow and `rescue` in Sorbet

I mentioned in [my last post] that Sorbet builds a [**control flow graph**]{.smallcaps} (CFG)
in order to model control-flow sensitive types throughout the body of a method. For `rescue`
nodes, it pretends that there are only two jumps into the `rescue` block: once **before any**
any code in the `begin` block has run, and once after all the code in `begin` block has
run. It looks a little something like this:

:::{.only-light-mode}
![An example CFG with a `rescue` block](/assets/img/rescue-cfg-light-mode.png)
:::

:::{.only-dark-mode}
![An example CFG with a `rescue` block](/assets/img/rescue-cfg-dark-mode.png)
:::

This is a simplified view of a CFG in Sorbet.[^mostly] The boxes contain hunks of straight-line
code (code without control flow), and all control flow is made explicit by branching on a
specified variable at the end of each block. For the case of `rescue`, the branches read from a
magical `<exn-value>` variable, which Sorbet treats as [**unanalyzable**]{.smallcaps}: Sorbet
doesn't attempt to track how the value is initialized nor how control flow affects it.

[^mostly]:
  If you have [Graphviz] installed, you can get Sorbet to dump its internal CFG for a given
  file with the `cfg-view.sh` script in the Sorbet repo. The CFG for the example above looks
  like [like this](/assets/img/rescue-example-01.svg).

Knowing this, we can explain the weird dead code error from the snippet above:

- The first jump into the `rescue` block happens before any code in the `begin` block runs.
  At that point, the `loop_count` variable is still uninitialized, and thus has type `NilClass`
  when taking that branch.
- The second jump into the `rescue` block happens after the `begin` block finishes. But from
  Sorbet's point of view, the `begin` block in the `loop_count` snippet never finishes! Sorbet
  sees the infinite `while true` loop and says, "it doesn't matter where to branch at the end
  of the `begin` blockâ€”the infinite loop won't allow control to flow there."[^loop] Despite
  it being able to tell that `loop_count` has type `Integer` inside the `begin`, only the
  `NilClass` branch is live in the `rescue` block.

[^loop]:
  If you're fearless, you can prove that this is what's happening in the [rendered
  CFG](/assets/img/rescue-example-01.svg) for the above example.

That second point about `while true` is [simply a bug][4108]. Sorbet should be smart enough to
suspend the normal flow-sensitivity rules for infinite loops while checking code in a `begin`
block that has a `rescue`.[^said] But still, fixing that bug would only fix half the problem:
Sorbet would think that `loop_count` has type `T.nilable(Integer)` in the `rescue`
body, but we said the best outcome would be for Sorbet to know that `loop_count` is **always**
initialized, having type `Integer`.

[^said]:
  Of course, easier said than done.

Before we can see what it would take for Sorbet to infer `Integer`, some history.

# A brief history of `rescue` in Sorbet

Sorbet's [first commit] dates to October 3, 2017. Six weeks later, the [initial support for
`rescue`][afb23474] landed. The pull request description is from a time when all pull requests
were not public, so I'll quote it here:

> This does most of the work in the CFG, preserving the semantics in the desugarer. [...]
>
> It introduces a series of uncomputable `if`s since 0 or more instructions from the first
> block will execute then one of the `rescue`s could match and then if none do the `else` will
> match.

The approach it's describing is what most people might do intuitively: any instruction in a
`begin` might raise,[^not-quite] so let's record an unanalyzable jump after each instruction,
into the `rescue` block. In picture form:

[^not-quite]:
  This is not quite true: `x = 0` doesn't raise, and Sorbet can [see that syntactically][my
  last post]. This might be something to take advantage of in the future.

:::{.only-dark-mode}

:::

Note how every line of the `begin` body gets its own, tiny basic block with an unanalyzable
jump to the `rescue` block, or to the next line of the body. This implementation wouldn't have
exhibited the bug in our `loop_count` exampleâ€”there would be a jump after the `loop_count = 0`
assignment into the `rescue` block, which would have been enough for Sorbet to infer a type of
`Integer` (regardless of whether that `while true` bug were fixed method).

But importantly, this original approach was thrown out, [almost exactly 9 months
later][a6ed41e0][^2018], when the shortcut we've been discussing arrived. In fact, a
comment from that commit persists unchanged in the codebase today:

Why adopt this shortcut approach if it _causes_ bugs like this to happen? Well for starters,
the original approach had an even more insidious bug. Consider this example:

```ruby
begin
  x = might_raise()
  # ...
rescue
  # Sorbet would assume `x` was always set
  puts(x)
end
```

In this example, the first instruction in the block is an assignment (`x = ...`). But Sorbet
would only record the jump after the assignment entirely, not between the method call and the
assignment. This meant Sorbet would think that `x` was unconditionally set, but in fact it's
**not** set when `might_raise()` does actually raise. At the time, Sorbet tripped this bug all
the time on real-world codeâ€”there were beta users of Sorbet chiming in on the PR eagerly
waiting for the bug to be fixed. Meanwhile, code that looked like our `loop_count` example
either did not exist or was simply rewritten[^unconditional] to avoid the bug.

[^unconditional]:
  There's an easy workaround: use `T.let` to pin the type of the variable outside the `begin`
  block.

But this still doesn't quite paint the full picture. I've told you, "There was a bug, and Sorbet
fixed it by introducing another bug." Which leads us to out second point: having a lot of tiny,
jumpy basic blocks is slow to typecheck. There are lots of reasons:

- After building a CFG, Sorbet does a bunch of post-processing on it. For example, it computes
  which variables each basic block reads and writes, tries to dealias variable writes, and
  merges adjacent blocks if possible. When there are fewer basic blocks, these post-processing
  steps run faster to begin with, and are more likely to drastically shrink the CFG size
  (making type inference run faster).

- When typechecking a method, every basic block in the CFG requires its own [`Environment`]
  data structure, which maps variables to their types within that block. Sorbet either has to
  allocate a separate `Environment` per block (what it currently does) or incur complexity
  from making them [copy-on-write]. [Allocating is slow][nelhage-sorbet-fast] and we really
  like to avoid complexity.

- Before typechecking a basic block, Sorbet has to merge the environments of all incoming
  blocks. Merging environments involves doing slow type checking operations, like checking
  whether two possibly-arbitrary types are subtypes of each other and allocating union types.

- Not only are there more basic blocks, there are more instructions! Each `<exn-value>`
  variable has to be populated before Sorbet can branch on it, and that each tiny basic block
  has not only the single instruction inside it, but also an extra instruction to initialize
  the `<exn-valu>` variable. That basically doubles the number of instructions Sorbet emits for
  a `begin` block, making more work for type inference.

The new "only before and after" shortcut is pretty clever. In practice, it models the case when
even the very first assignment might raise, while generating far fewer basic blocks, thus
running much faster.

# The bigger picture

There are a lot of these clever "good enough" tricks in Sorbet. Many of them are only possible
because of the stakes: Sorbet _already_ allows [`T.untyped`], so depending on your viewpoint,
either:

- There is already the holy grail of all hacks in the type system, so why not cut more corners
  when it makes sense.
- _Because_ `T.untyped` is in the type system, at least the user can use `T.untyped` to not be
  completely blocked from writing the code they need to write.

Either way, in some sense the stakes are low. In a compiler where the stakes for being wrong
are higher (the code computes the wrong answer), maybe shortcuts aren't the best idea. And in
fact, [multiple][2962] [distinct][3044] [exception][4488] [changes][4531] landed in Sorbet's
CFG code to support the Sorbet Compiler.

It's now been over four years since we shipped the change to model `rescue` this way. I'm not
aware of a single incident caused by this shortcut, and I can only even remember explaining
this behavior to a confused Sorbet user twice. I can't find any performance numbers from when
the original change landed, but we can still put it into perspective: it's the difference
between a handful of people being confused over the course of 4 years, or thousands of people
getting faster typechecking results thousands of times per day. Seems like a reasonable
trade-off.

Though eventually it would be nice to at least fix [that `while true` bug][4108]. ðŸ˜…
